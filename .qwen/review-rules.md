# Qwen Code Review Rules

These are the project-specific review criteria for Qwen Code. Bundled
`/review` loads this file and applies the rules below to its review agents.
Apply them conservatively: the goal is to reduce review noise and route
unclear PRs to maintainers, not to make final product decisions on weak
evidence.

> Scope note: this file describes _what_ to evaluate and _how strong_ a
> finding is. It does NOT describe workflow mechanics (when the CI gate
> stops, when a process comment is posted, how to re-trigger). Those live in
> `docs/design/code-review/code-review-design.md` and the workflow itself.
> When `/review` runs locally on uncommitted changes there is no CI gate —
> treat the rules below as review guidance, not as a process to enforce.

## Finding Severity

How strongly to weight each gate's findings. "blocking" means a failure here
is a high-priority, actionable finding the author should resolve before the
change is mergeable; "advisory" means flag it but it does not by itself block.

| Gate                    | Default severity | Override token (in this file)      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Scope / PR Purity       | blocking         | `scope-gate: advisory`             |
| Product Direction       | blocking         | `product-direction-gate: advisory` |
| Validation / Dogfooding | advisory         | `validation-gate: blocking`        |

## Review Gates

### Scope And PR Purity

- Prefer small, focused PRs that can be reviewed and validated independently.
- Flag PRs that mix unrelated product changes, broad refactors, dependency
  churn, formatting, and feature implementation in one changeset.
- Large implementation PRs should clearly separate planning/rationale from
  mechanical code changes. If the rationale is missing, ask for it before
  reviewing code details.

### Product Direction

- New features should fit Qwen Code's existing CLI/TUI-first developer workflow,
  composable tool model, slash-command behavior, and repository conventions.
- Do not reward PRs that add popular external features only because another
  tool has them. The author should explain why the feature belongs in Qwen Code
  and how it fits existing interaction patterns.
- Ask for maintainer discussion when a PR changes core agent behavior, tool
  permissions, authentication, model selection, sandboxing, telemetry, release
  flow, or public CLI/SDK contracts without a clear design rationale.
- Prefer incremental extensions over rewrites unless the PR explains why the
  existing design cannot support the change.

### Validation And Dogfooding

- Feature PRs and user-visible behavior changes should include reviewer-facing
  validation evidence, not just "tested locally".
- Good evidence includes exact commands, prompts, inputs, observed output,
  logs, JSON traces, before/after examples, screenshots, GIFs, or short videos.
- CLI-only changes can be validated with command transcripts and observed
  output when they demonstrate the changed behavior.
- TUI, interactive, visual, or workflow changes should include a screenshot,
  GIF, video, or equivalent before/after evidence whenever practical.
- Dogfooding notes should explain the quickest reviewer path to exercise the
  feature and what result to expect.

### Functional Review

- Once the gates pass, focus detailed code review on correctness, security,
  maintainability, performance, test coverage, and compatibility with existing
  Qwen Code conventions.
- Prefer high-signal findings with concrete impact. Avoid style preferences,
  speculative best-practice commentary, and issues already covered by linters,
  typecheckers, or existing PR comments.
