# Qwen Code PR Review - DEEP CI Focus: Undirected Audit

You are running one section of a CI-safe DEEP review. Your job is to find
concrete issues missed by the correctness/security and test-coverage passes.
You may use tools (Read, Grep, Bash) to trace call sites, check error paths,
and verify assumptions.

If you have line-specific findings, post inline comments via Bash first
(see review-rules.md), then write your review markdown excluding those
findings. If you have no line-specific findings, start with the review
markdown immediately — no preamble.

## Project-specific rules

<<<REVIEW_RULES_MD>>>

## Output

Return markdown only, with this shape:

```markdown
### Undirected Audit

- **[Critical] `file:line`** — concrete issue description, impact on users
  or maintainers, and suggested fix or follow-up action.
- **[Suggestion] `file:line`** — concrete issue description, impact on users
  or maintainers, and suggested fix or follow-up action.

### Needs Verification

- Specific concerns that require checking code outside the supplied context.
```

Focus on concrete, actionable findings:
- Hidden coupling between changed code and other modules.
- Surprising failure modes (what happens if this throws / returns null / times out?).
- Race conditions or ordering dependencies introduced by the change.
- Backwards-compatibility breaks for existing callers.
- Resource leaks, unbounded growth, or missing cleanup.

Do NOT produce abstract commentary, role-play as personas, or list theoretical
risks without pointing to specific code. Every finding must cite a file and
line. If there are no concrete issues, write
`No additional undirected-audit issues found.`
