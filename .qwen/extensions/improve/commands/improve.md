description: Run one meaningful repository improvement now, or schedule it to repeat in this session.
whenToUse: Use when you want a prompt-orchestrated codebase improvement workflow with session-scoped scheduling, worktree isolation, and dev plus test subagents.
---

You are the controller for `/improve`.

The raw user arguments are:

`{{args}}`

Your job is to interpret the invocation, use tools directly, and finish in one
turn.

## Default Behavior

If the raw user arguments are empty, this is a valid request to run one
immediate improvement. Do not explain the command, do not show usage examples,
and do not ask what the user wants to do. Start the one-shot workflow with no
direction and select one meaningful repository improvement yourself.

## Core Rules

- Do not provide command help unless the user explicitly asks for help, usage,
  or examples.
- Never tell the user to use `/loop`.
- Use `cron_create`, `cron_list`, and `cron_delete` directly.
- Use `ask_user_question` only while setting up a new recurring `/improve`
  job. Never ask the user questions from a stored `/improve:once` prompt.
- Any recurring job created by this command must store a prompt that begins
  with `/improve:once`.
- Only treat cron jobs whose prompt starts with `/improve:once` as belonging to
  this command.
- Keep recurring jobs session-scoped. Do not write scheduler state to disk.
- Store the user's recurring context choices inside the cron prompt itself.
- If you schedule a recurring job, immediately perform the first one-shot
  attempt in this same turn. Do not wait for the next cron fire.
- If recurring mode is unavailable because cron tools are not available, say
  that recurring `/improve` is unavailable in the current session because cron
  is disabled. Tell the user to enable it with `experimental.cron: true` in
  settings or `QWEN_CODE_ENABLE_CRON=1`, then stop. Do not continue into a
  one-shot improvement unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- For the immediate attempt after scheduling, follow the one-shot workflow
  below in the current turn. Do not try to invoke `/improve:once` from inside
  this same turn.

## Mode Parsing

Parse the arguments in this order:

1. Empty args: run one-shot with no direction.
2. Exactly `list`: list only `/improve:once` jobs.
3. Exactly `clear`: delete only `/improve:once` jobs.
4. Starts with `--once`: strip it and run one-shot.
5. Starts with `--direction`: treat the rest as the one-shot direction.
6. Starts with `--every`: parse the next interval token or interval phrase as
   the cadence; the rest is the direction.
7. Ends with `every <interval>`: recurring.
8. Starts with `每隔 <interval>` or `每 <interval>`: recurring.
9. Ends with `每隔 <interval>`: recurring.
10. Otherwise: one-shot with the full remaining text as the direction.

## Stored Context Flags

Recurring jobs encode their session-scoped context profile in the stored
`/improve:once` prompt. The `/improve:once` command recognizes these flags:

- `--direction <text>`: the user's original high-level direction.
- `--context-sources <csv>`: comma-separated context sources selected during
  recurring setup. Supported values:
  - `github-issues`
  - `repo-specs`
  - `codebase-signals`
  - `user-context` only when the user supplies free-form context through the
    tool's automatic free-form option
- `--scope <text>`: the concrete product/code area selected by the user after
  initial exploration.
- `--user-context <text>`: free-form context supplied by the user.

When building stored prompts, keep values shell-style quoted when they contain
spaces. Do not create files to preserve these choices; the cron prompt is the
only storage.

## Interval Parsing

Accept these interval forms:

- short English: `30m`, `2h`, `1d`, `45s`
- long English: `30 minutes`, `2 hours`, `1 day`
- simple Chinese: `30分钟`, `30 分钟`, `2小时`, `2 小时`, `1天`, `1 天`

Convert the interval to cron with these rules:

- minutes under 60: `*/N * * * *`
- hours under 24: `0 */N * * *`
- days: `0 0 */N * *`
- seconds: round up to whole minutes, minimum 1 minute
- uneven intervals such as `90m`: round to the nearest clean cadence and say
  what you rounded to

Prefer these clean minute values: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30`

Prefer these clean hour values: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12`

## Recurring Behavior

If the invocation is recurring:

1. Resolve the direction from the invocation, if any.
2. Run recurring context setup before creating the cron job:
   - If there is no direction, ask the user which context sources should guide
     this improvement loop. Use `ask_user_question` with `multiSelect: true` and
     offer exactly these choices:
     - GitHub issues
     - Repository specs, PRDs, plans, and design docs
     - Codebase signals such as TODOs, brittle tests, complex modules, recent
       churn, and missing coverage
       Do not include a separate `User context` option; the tool's automatic
       free-form option already covers that case.
   - If there is a direction, first inspect the codebase lightly enough to find
     the plausible areas related to that direction. Then ask the user one
     targeted `ask_user_question` question to pick the scope that future loop
     runs should stay focused on. Include `Keep the whole direction broad` as
     one of the options when appropriate.
   - If the user provides free-form context through the tool's automatic Other
     option, preserve it as `--user-context`.
   - If `ask_user_question` is unavailable in the current execution mode,
     continue without scheduling if the missing answer would make the loop
     ambiguous. Otherwise use the explicit direction plus `codebase-signals`
     and say that the recurring job was created without interactive context
     setup.
   - If `cron_create` is not available after setup, do not create a fake
     schedule and do not continue with a one-shot fallback. Explain that cron is
     disabled and must be enabled with `experimental.cron: true` or
     `QWEN_CODE_ENABLE_CRON=1`.
3. Build the stored prompt beginning with `/improve:once` and include the
   resolved profile, for example:
   - `/improve:once --context-sources github-issues,repo-specs`
   - `/improve:once --direction "improve auth flow" --context-sources github-issues,repo-specs --scope "CLI auth and session handling"`
   - `/improve:once --context-sources codebase-signals,user-context --user-context "prefer small bug fixes with tests"`
4. Call `cron_create` with that prompt and `recurring=true`.
5. Mention the job id, the human cadence, that recurring jobs auto-expire after
   3 days, and the stored context profile.
6. Then continue into the one-shot workflow below in the same turn using the
   same resolved direction and context profile. Do not ask the user again.

## List Behavior

- Call `cron_list`.
- Show only jobs whose prompt starts with `/improve:once`.
- If none exist, say there are no scheduled improve jobs.

## Clear Behavior

- Call `cron_list`.
- Delete only jobs whose prompt starts with `/improve:once`.
- Report how many scheduled improve jobs were deleted.

## One-Shot Workflow

Use this workflow both for direct one-shot invocations and for the immediate
run that happens after scheduling.

### 1. Create an isolated worktree

- Discover the repo root with git.
- Create a unique temporary worktree from `HEAD` on a real local branch.
- Use this branch naming format:
  `improve/<kind>-<task-slug>-YYYY-MM-DD-<hash>`.
  - `task-slug`: short lowercase kebab-case description, no spaces.
  - `kind`: use `feature` by default; use `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, or `docs`
    when that better matches the selected task.
  - `YYYY-MM-DD`: the current local date.
  - `hash`: a short unique lowercase hex suffix, such as the current HEAD short
    hash; if that branch already exists, append or replace with a random short
    hex suffix.
  - Example: `improve/feature-todo-display-header-2026-04-24-57692188`.
- Create the worktree with a command equivalent to:
  `git worktree add -b <branch-name> <worktree-path> HEAD`.
  Do not use `git worktree add <worktree-path> HEAD`, because that creates a
  detached HEAD worktree with no branch.
- After creating the worktree, verify it is on the expected branch with
  `git -C <worktree-path> symbolic-ref --short HEAD`. If the branch does not
  match, remove the worktree, delete any partial branch if needed, report that
  setup failed, and stop.
- Use a temp directory under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`.
- Do not rely on shell cwd persistence. Every shell command must explicitly use
  the worktree path.

### 2. Select one meaningful task

- Narrow the direction into exactly one coherent, locally verifiable repository
  improvement.
- If stored or resolved context sources are present, use them to gather task
  candidates before choosing:
  - `github-issues`: use `gh` to inspect open issues that look actionable,
    clear, and locally verifiable. Prefer bugs or scoped enhancements that do
    not require product judgment. Before selecting an issue, verify that it
    does not already have an open PR or obvious active fix in progress:
    inspect linked/closing PR metadata when available, search open PR titles
    and bodies for references such as `#<issue-number>`, `fixes #<issue-number>`,
    `closes #<issue-number>`, or the issue title, and skip issues with an
    associated PR unless the PR is closed/abandoned and the issue remains open.
  - `repo-specs`: look for repository specs, PRDs, plans, RFCs, design notes,
    and docs that describe intended behavior or unfinished work.
  - `codebase-signals`: inspect the codebase for high-signal local
    opportunities such as TODOs tied to behavior, brittle tests, obvious missing
    coverage, complexity hotspots, recent churn, or small correctness issues.
  - `user-context`: apply the user-provided context as a hard preference while
    still requiring the task to be locally verifiable.
- If a stored scope is present, stay inside that scope unless it leads to no
  worthwhile task; if you step outside it, explain why in the final response.
- Prefer meaningful bug fixes, feature slices, test coverage that protects real
  behavior, maintainability improvements, or refactors with a clear payoff.
- The task may touch as many files as the implementation genuinely requires, but
  it must remain a single connected change with an obvious validation strategy.
- If no direction is provided, inspect the repository for a high-signal
  improvement that a developer would reasonably accept as useful, not merely
  cosmetic churn.
- Avoid changes whose only value is rewording, formatting, dependency churn, or
  speculative cleanup unless the direction explicitly asks for that.
- Do not deliberately downscope a real bugfix or feature direction into
  documentation, comments, or text polish.
- If no worthwhile verifiable task exists, remove the worktree, report that this
  run skipped, and stop.

### 3. Delegate implementation

Call the `agent` tool with `subagent_type="improve-dev"`.

The dev prompt must include:

- repo root
- isolated worktree path
- branch name
- selected task
- original direction, if any
- a requirement to keep the diff coherent and stay inside the worktree
- a requirement to run checks appropriate to the changed behavior
- a requirement not to commit

### 4. Delegate verification

Call the `agent` tool with `subagent_type="improve-test"`.

The test prompt must include:

- isolated worktree path
- selected task
- the expected validation scope
- a requirement to stay read-only
- a requirement to start the final answer with one of:
  - `Status: pass`
  - `Status: fail`
  - `Status: blocked`

### 5. Repair loop

- If validation returns `Status: fail`, do up to 2 repair rounds.
- Feed the failure output back to `improve-dev`, then rerun `improve-test`.
- If validation still fails after 2 repair rounds, remove the worktree and
  report a rollback.
- If validation is `Status: blocked` because the environment cannot provide a
  trustworthy check, remove the worktree and report that the run stopped
  without keeping a change.

### 6. Success criteria

Only keep the worktree if all of these are true:

- validation ended with `Status: pass`
- the worktree has a non-empty diff
- the change still matches the selected task

If the diff is empty, remove the worktree and report that no useful change was
kept.

## Final Response

Keep the final response concise and concrete.

If scheduling was requested, include:

- scheduled job id
- cadence
- the stored prompt

For the one-shot attempt, include:

- selected task
- outcome: `success`, `skipped`, `rolled back`, or `stopped`
- worktree path if kept
- branch name if kept
- changed files
- validation commands and results
- one short note on remaining risk, if any
