# Local PR verification

## Motivation

The pre-commit hook is intentionally fast: it formats and lints only staged
files. The legacy `npm run preflight` command is broader, but it runs Prettier
in write mode and omits several PR CI checks. Neither is the final local PR
gate.

Use three levels of feedback:

1. During development, run focused tests from the affected package.
2. Keep the existing pre-commit hook for fast staged-file feedback.
3. After committing and before the first PR push or an update push, run
   `npm run verify:pr`.

There is no repository pre-push hook. The full gate includes network access
and the full workspace test suite, so it remains an explicit developer action.

## Interface and guards

```bash
npm run verify:pr
npm run verify:pr -- --base origin/release/<branch>
npm run verify:pr -- --profile auto
```

The default base is `origin/main`, and the default profile is `full`. Full is
intentionally conservative. `--profile auto` is an opt-in optimization that
reuses the CI changed-file classifier.

Before validation starts, the command requires Node 22.x on macOS x64/ARM64 or
Linux x64. It also requires a caller working tree with no staged, unstaged, or
untracked files, a resolvable base commit and merge base, and at least one
committed change between that merge base and `HEAD`.

For profiles that run commands, the gate creates an owned detached temporary
worktree at the exact SHA captured during caller inspection, disables checkout
hooks, runs validation there, and removes it afterward.
Commands that install, build, or generate files therefore do not change the
caller's tracked checkout. Developers do not need to create a separate worktree
themselves. A docs-only auto profile finishes after the same caller guards
without creating the temporary worktree.

On POSIX systems, the owned container is created below the canonical `/tmp`
path. This avoids both macOS `/var` aliases and excessively long per-user
temporary paths. Build outputs, dependency caches, browser binaries, homes, and
verifier-owned temporary files stay inside the container. Git temporarily
registers the detached worktree in repository metadata until cleanup.

Installation forces lifecycle scripts to run so the build and bundle cannot
be skipped by caller npm settings, while disabling Husky setup to avoid
changing the linked worktrees' shared hook configuration.

## Profiles

- `full` runs the complete deterministic local gate and is always selected
  unless `auto` is requested.
- `docs_only` is selected by `auto` only when every changed path is classified
  as documentation. It performs the caller guards and skips validation
  commands.
- `github_ci_only` is selected by `auto` only when every changed path belongs
  to the CI safety-helper set. It sets up linters, runs actionlint and yamllint,
  and runs the associated Node helper tests.

Mixed or unrecognized changes select `full`.

## Full validation

The full profile runs these categories in fail-fast order:

- clean installation in the fresh detached checkout: `npm ci` invokes the
  repository `prepare` script, which runs the build and bundle;
- critical runtime dependency audit, lockfile validation, and desktop
  workspace isolation;
- ESLint, actionlint, shellcheck, yamllint, and a read-only Prettier check of
  regular files changed by the PR that still exist at `HEAD`;
- the GitHub CI profile-classifier and safety-helper tests;
- i18n validation, read-only settings-schema freshness plus a check that the
  build left the committed schema unchanged, type checking, and the serve
  fast-path bundle-closure check;
- all workspace unit tests plus script tests, with workspaces and test files
  scheduled serially to keep the repository-wide run stable under local load;
  the test contents and coverage settings stay unchanged;
- no-AK integration tests, an isolated Chromium installation, and the web-shell
  Playwright smoke test on a dynamically allocated localhost port.

Every validation subprocess receives an isolated temporary home and a small
allowlist of transport-related caller variables such as `PATH`, proxy settings,
and certificate paths. Caller credentials, npm/pip modes, Qwen state paths,
test overrides, and Playwright redirects are not inherited. Python and npm use
owned configuration and cache paths.

When the PR changes `packages/sdk-python/` or its CI workflow, the full profile
also requires `uv` and creates isolated Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
environments. Each version installs the SDK development dependencies and runs
Ruff lint and format checks, Mypy, and Pytest.

The existing sensitive-keyword no-op is intentionally not part of this gate.

## Failures and remote boundaries

The gate stops at the first failed step. Output includes the step and a safely
escaped command before execution; validation failures also report the exact
`HEAD`, selected base and profile, and direct developers to rerun the gate.
It preserves a child's numeric exit code. `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` received by
the verifier are relayed after cleanup; other child-only signals use the
conventional `128 + signal` exit status. The gate
always attempts to remove the temporary worktree on success or failure.
`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` received while a validation command is running are
forwarded to its process group; a second signal force-terminates that group,
and the gate cleans up before relaying the original signal.
Cleanup failures are reported, including separately when a validation failure
already exists.

This gate does not replace remote CI. Unsupported hosts, including Windows and
Linux ARM64, fail before repository inspection. The gate cannot reproduce ECS
runner load or cache behavior, Windows and macOS merge-queue jobs, integrations
that use real secrets, GitHub permissions and artifact handling, review bots,
or every residual test flake. Remote checks remain authoritative for those
surfaces.
