/**
 * Injection seam for the ACP fs proxy on `BridgeClient.readTextFile` /
 * `BridgeClient.writeTextFile`. The immediate follow-up PR will land
 * a serve-side adapter that wraps PR 18's `WorkspaceFileSystem` so
 * production `qwen serve` writes pick up the TOCTOU + symlink +
 * trust-gate + audit machinery PR 18 introduced — closing the
 * post-PR-18 follow-up thread about `BridgeClient`'s inline fs
 * proxy bypassing `WorkspaceFileSystem` (originally raised in
 * #4250 review; see also FIXME(stage-1.5, chiga0 finding 4) lifted
 * to this package as part of #4175 F1). Until that adapter ships and `runQwenServe` wires it
 * through `BridgeOptions.fileSystem`, BridgeClient continues to use
 * its inline fs proxy (preserving pre-F1 behavior).
 *
 * Lifted from the inline `fs.writeFile` / `fs.readFile` implementations
 * BridgeClient carried before #4175 PR F1 (step 5, originally the
 * 22b' scope). Bridge tests + Mode A embedded callers can omit the
 * field on `BridgeOptions`; BridgeClient falls back to its inline
 * proxy so the pre-lift behavior is preserved verbatim when no
 * provider is injected.
 *
 * Method signatures intentionally mirror the ACP SDK request/response
 * shapes so the adapter does the minimum amount of translation
 * (`{ path, content }` ↔ `WorkspaceFileSystem`'s `ResolvedPath` brand
 * types + options bag).

   *      / procfs / sysfs entries can produce unbounded data on
   *      read despite reporting `stats.size === 0`). Inline path
   *      throws with `describeStatKind(stats)` in the message.
   *   2. Cap the buffered size (the inline path uses
   *      `READ_FILE_SIZE_CAP = 100 MiB` to defend against a small
   *      `{ line: 1, limit: 10 }` request against a 500 MB log
   *      from costing 500 MB of RSS just to return 10 lines).
