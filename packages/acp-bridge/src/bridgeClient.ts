 * Duck-type check for `FsError` from `cli/src/serve/fs/errors.ts`
 * (#4175 F4 prereq — Codex review on #4360 round 2). FsError lives
 * in the `cli` package, but this class lives in `acp-bridge` — a
 * direct `import { FsError }` would invert the dependency. We use
 * the same `.name`-based duck typing that `mapDomainErrorToErrorKind`
 * (status.ts) already applies to `TrustGateError` / `SkillError`
 * for the same cross-package bundling reason.
 *
 * Without this preservation: when the `BridgeFileSystem` adapter
 * throws an `FsError` (e.g. `kind: 'untrusted_workspace'`, `kind:
 * 'symlink_escape'`, `kind: 'file_too_large'`), the ACP SDK's
 * default RPC error path serializes only `error.message` as
 * "Internal error" — the structured `kind` / `status` / `hint` are
 * lost on the wire. SDK consumers downstream can no longer dispatch
 * typed UI (auth retry vs file picker vs proxy hint) without
 * regex-matching the human-readable message.
 *
 * With this preservation: the bridge boundary catches FsError,
 * rethrows as ACP `RequestError(-32603, message, {errorKind, hint,
 * status})`. The agent's RPC client receives `data.errorKind` and
 * can branch on the closed-enum kind. JSON-RPC code stays at
 * internal-error (-32603) since the bridge can't reliably map
 * FsError.kind to a JSON-RPC error code shape — the structured
 * `data` field is what carries semantic information for SDK
