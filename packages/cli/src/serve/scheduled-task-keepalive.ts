/**
 * Keeps scheduled-task-owned sessions resident against the bridge's idle
 * reaper.
 *
 * A durable task created through the Web Shell management page is bound to a
 * dedicated session and fires ONLY inside it (its transcript is the task's run
 * history). For that to keep happening the session must stay loaded so its
 * in-child scheduler ticks — but a session with no client / SSE subscriber is
 * closed by the bridge's idle reaper after the idle timeout, which would
 * silently stop the task.
 *
 * This is a periodic heartbeat: it reads the durable-tasks file, collects the
 * distinct bound session ids, and calls `bridge.recordHeartbeat` on each so the
 * reaper's "idle since" clock never crosses the timeout. When a heartbeat fails
 * because the session is no longer resident — the common case being a task that
 * was disabled/archived (its session let go by the reaper) and then re-enabled/
 * unarchived — it best-effort RELOADS the session so its in-child scheduler
 * resumes ticking. Without that, a re-enabled bound task would show enabled with
 * a live countdown yet never fire until the user opened it or the daemon
 * restarted. This revive covers the unarchive path and the PATCH false→true
 * path uniformly, and retries every interval; a slot missed during the revive
 * gap is caught up when the session loads.
