// Session-state helpers for the `qwen review` subcommands.

// `fetch-pr` writes a JSON report at a canonical path. Downstream subcommands
// (`pr-context`, `presubmit`, `deterministic`, `autofix-gate`) read that
// report to verify the review session is properly set up — i.e. the worktree
// exists and the user's working tree was not bypassed by `gh pr checkout` or
// equivalent. When the report is missing, the subcommand refuses to run with
// a clear error pointing back at `fetch-pr`. This makes the worktree flow a
// hard precondition rather than a prose rule that a weakly instruction-
// following model can skip.
