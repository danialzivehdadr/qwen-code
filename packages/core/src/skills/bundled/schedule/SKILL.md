# /schedule — local always-on scheduled tasks (routines)

A scheduled task is a durable routine stored under `~/.qwen/scheduled-tasks/`.
The `qwen schedule daemon` process fires each due task as a fresh headless
`qwen -p` run in the task's own working directory — so tasks keep running with
no interactive session open. This is distinct from `/loop`, which only runs
while the current session stays open.

## Subcommands

Strip the `/schedule` prefix, then look at the input:

- **empty** — call ScheduleList and show the result. Done.
- **`list`** — call ScheduleList and show the result. Done.
- **`run <id>`** — call ScheduleRun with that id. Report the run id it returns. Done.
- **`delete <id>`** (also `remove`, `rm`) — call ScheduleDelete with that id. Confirm. Done.
- **anything else** — treat the whole input as a natural-language request to
  create a task (see below).

## Creating a task

When the input describes work to schedule, create it with **ScheduleCreate**.
Resolve these fields from the request, then confirm the resolved schedule when
you create it:

1. **Schedule** — pass exactly one:
   - `cron` (5-field, local time) for recurring requests. Examples:
     `0 9 * * 1-5` = weekdays 9am, `0 * * * *` = hourly, `*/30 * * * *` = every 30 min.
   - `fireAt` (ISO 8601 with offset) for a one-shot ("once", "tomorrow at 3pm",
     "in 2 weeks"). Resolve the phrase against the current date/time to an
     absolute timestamp and confirm it.
   - Prefer off-`:00`/`:30` minutes for approximate times (e.g. `57 8 * * *`
     instead of `0 9 * * *`) so many machines don't all hit the API at once.
2. **prompt** — a fully self-contained instruction. The task runs headless with
   NO memory of this conversation, so restate the repo/cwd, the goal, and what
   success looks like. Do not reference "the current conversation".
3. **name** — a short kebab-case id (e.g. `daily-pr-review`).
4. **description** — a one-line summary for the list.
5. **cwd** — default to the current working directory unless the user names
   another. Use an absolute path.
6. **approvalMode** (optional) — how the unattended run is gated. If omitted it
   inherits the user's current session mode. Because the run is headless with no
   one to approve, only `yolo` reliably lets a task **write files or run shell
   commands**; `auto`, `default`, and `plan` block those actions (auto's
   classifier isn't available headless) and record them as blocked. **If the
   task edits files, runs commands, or opens PRs, set `approvalMode: yolo`** —
   or, if the user's global mode is already `yolo`, omitting it is fine. Only use
   the more restrictive modes for read-only/reporting tasks.
7. **model** / **sandbox** (optional) — per-task model id; run inside the sandbox.

Creating a task **auto-starts the background daemon**, so you do not need to
tell the user to run anything by hand. After creating, tell the user in one or
two lines: what was scheduled, the human-readable cadence (or absolute one-shot
time), and relay the daemon status from the tool result (started / already
running). Only mention `qwen schedule daemon` if the tool reports auto-start was
disabled or failed. Manage tasks later with `/schedule list`, `/schedule run
<id>`, and `/schedule delete <id>`.

Note: the daemon runs on this machine while it is powered on; it does not yet
auto-restart after a reboot (that is a planned enhancement).
